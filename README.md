# Analysis Helper
This repository contains the script AnalysisHelper.py, which can be used to help clean, explore, and visualize data. It also contains folders with data for two projects for which this analysis script has been used. 

The main goal of this project was to create a living script containing functions and classes that can be reused on future behavioral and eyetracking projects, but it can also be adapted for use on other types of data.


#I'll go through and explain the classes and folder structure here
